            大体流程为：</br>
            1.构思布局</br>
            2.区域划分</br>
            3.填充内容</br>
            4.调整版式</br>
            5.添加效果</br>
            6.测试调整：手机pad自适应</br>
            7.部署至github</br>
            <p>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp根据构思将页面分块，html常用标签是div，还有一些个其他标签比如span，ul，table可以用来布局，可以按需要选择。分区完毕，我们对区块做一些描述，高宽位置，让它们放在需要的地方。之后插入一些内容，文字图片之类，有相应标签。之后可以对区块和元素加描述，进行修饰点缀。描述可以写在html里面，但是最好还是写入一个css文件中，比较方便管理。如果我们想加些动态效果，可以通过简单函数(就是所谓js)，配合样式实现。页面基本上达到效果后，我们最后检测一下，当屏幕改变时的呈现效果，在一定程度上，是可以自适应的，但是有些情况就无能为力。我这里通过在css中加判定，当屏宽小于759px时，更改样式来实现手机端的适应。至此排版部分结束。最后一步，部署上线，有很多平台，这里通过github来部署，建立一个用户名.github.io库，将文件上传，找到域名，点进去就是个人网站啦。
以上 一个静态个人网站建立完毕 。</br>
如有疏漏错误，敬请提出指正。

Artist: Iron Maiden
Album: The Final Frontier
Have you heard what they said on the news today</br>
Have you heard what is coming to us all?</br>
That the world as we know it will be coming to an end</br>
Have you heard, have you heard?</br>
He sees them in the distance when the darkened clouds roll</br>
He could feel tension in the atmosphere</br>
He would look in the mirror, see an old man now</br>
Does it matter they survive somehow</br>
They said there's nothing can be done about the situation</br>
They said there's nothing you can do at all</br>
To sit and wait around for something to occur</br>
Did you know, did you know?</br>
As he stares across the garden looking at the meadows</br>
Wonders if they'll ever grow again</br>
The desperation of the situation getting graver</br>
Getting ready when the wild wind blows</br>
Have you seen what they said on the news today</br>
Have you heard what they said about us all</br>
Do you know what is happening to just every one of us</br>
Have you heard, have you heard?</br>
There will be a catastrophe the like we've never seen</br>
There will be something that will light the sky</br>
That the world as we know it, it will never be the same</br>
Did you know, did you know?</br>
He carries everything into the shelter not a fuss</br>
Getting ready when the moment comes</br>
He has enough supplies to last them for a year or two</br>
Good to have because you never know</br>
They tell us nothing that we don't already know about</br>
They tell us nothing that is real at all</br>
They only fill us with the stuff that they want</br>
Did you know, did you know?</br>
He's nearly finished with the preparations for the day</br>
He's getting tired; that'll do for now</br>
They are preparing for the very worst to come to them</br>
Getting ready when the wild wind blows</br>
He sees the picture on the wall, it's falling down</br>
Upside down</br>
He sees a teardrop from his wife roll down her face,</br>
Saying Grace</br>
Remember times they had, they flash right through his mind</br>
Left behind</br>
Of a lifetime spent together long ago</br>
Will be gone</br>
Solo</br>
They've been preparing for some weeks now</br>
For when the crucial moment comes</br>
To take their refuge in the shelter</br>
Let them prepare for what will come</br>
They make a tea and sit there waiting</br>
They're in the shelter feeling snug</br>
Not long to wait for absolution</br>
Don't make a fuss; just sit and wait</br>
Can't believe all the lying,</br>
All the screens are denying</br>
That the moments of truth have begun</br>
Can't you see it on the T.V.?</br>
Don't believe them in the least bit</br>
Now the days of our ending have begun</br>
Say a prayer when it's all over</br>
Survivors unite, all as one</br>
Got to try and help each other</br>
Got the will to overcome</br>
I can't believe all the lying,</br>
All the screens are denying</br>
That the moments of truth have begun</br>
Can't you see it on the T.V.?</br>
Don't believe them in the least bit</br>
Now the days of our ending have begun</br>
Solo</br>
When they found them, had their arms wrapped around each other</br>
Their tins of poison laying near by their clothes</br>
The day they both mistook an earthquake for the fallout</br>
Just another when the wild wind blows </div>

          <div class="blogdata">Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young</br>
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary</br>
The ringing of the division bell had begun</br>

Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway</br>
Do they still meet there by the Cut</br>

There was a ragged band that followed our footsteps</br>
Running before time took our dreams away</br>
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground</br>
To a life consumed by slow decay</br>

The grass was greener</br>
The light was brighter</br>
With friends surrounded</br>
The nights of wonder</br>

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us</br>
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side</br>
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again</br>
Dragged by force of some inner tide</br>
</br>
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled</br>
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world</br>

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition</br>
There's a hunger still unsatisfied</br>
Though down this road we've been so many times</br>
The grass was greener</br>
The light was brighter</br>
The taste was sweeter</br>
The nights of wonder</br>
With friends surrounded</br>
The dawn mist growing</br>
The water flowing</br>
The endless river</br>
Forever and ever </div>
